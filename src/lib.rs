/*
TODO
* limit stack frame size
* limit heap memory
- eg size of collections, ie add checks to push/insert etc

* limit stack memory
* limit global decls
* limit vars in gc
* limit loops
* rust func recursion size

* limits in compiler
- string/symbol/path length
- func args num
- call params num

* in compiler fix src locs for instructions (used in error reporting)

* add struct and method decls in script
- store methods in globals, can be captured ie if there is a call, any methods with name are captured
- - need to allow methods decl'd in included files to be captured too, but how to do at compile time?
- need to be able to define names for rust types eg libscope.def_type_name::<Array>("array");

* need a strategy to run gc automatically instead of the current manual running of it

* for scripts stored in config files need to be able to report correct line/col/pos/row in config file for errors

* for errors in generated code, need it to report back to position of config file used to generate it

TODO2
* allow methods to have typed return types
- if method call has
- - multiple returntyped methods, err
- - dynamic return the dynamic
- there is no type inference
- can force select method with return type by decl var with type
- - what if var is uninitialised? force typed vars to be initialised?

TODO3
* remove func calls from within methods
- instead have "continues", where a method or func call is set to be run after the rust method call ends
- - the params for the method are left on the stack
- - after the nominated call is finished, run the original method again
- - the return value of the method doing the call, is accessible from when the original method is called again

TODO

- methods can only be declared at root, and are initialised before everything else
- - what about when declared in another file and included, they won't be avail til the include?
- - - could initialise the includes also first, so their declared methods are also init first
- - - - and then run the rest (decl vars etc) once the include is reached

TODO
* store methods used in build, then check at runtime if they exists? no as can't know param types

TODO
* allow garbage collecting on single val
** so when val is dropped, or vals are dropped, can try to gc them immediately, also can add any other vals dropped in the process to the gc'ing list

TODO
* for closures that ref each other, instead of storing as a managed (gc'd), store them together as a single unmanaged, and index into them for each func, so only all dropped after last func/closure is dropped
** could be a problem if too many funcs all refing each other in a giant graph, but unlikely to be a situation, could also detect that and optionally not do this
** problem if a global the func is being stored in is a ref type?
*** probably not, just store a pointer to the mega closure into that global ref
*** if megaclosure stores a ref to a global (or even a local) ref, and that global/local ref stores a ref to that func, then will be circular
**** could make that global/local ref a part of the megaclosure,
**** or just disallow the creation of a megaclosure under those circumstances
***** would be nice to be able to have an option of not using a gc though

** problem if accessing global declared by another script, as can't check them at commpile time for circular ref
*** could have only work with funcs stored as local vars
**** would then need to allow local vars to be declared at root level, which are currently are globals
**** then not do megaclosures for functions stored as globals (or if not using gc, then error)
**** would need special var decl for globals eg "global g" instead of "var g"
***** allow declaration inside blocks/funcs/etc?

TODO
* have functions return void by default, and require return command to return a val
** also return by itself just returns void

TODO
* could have when set_field returns non void, then use it to set next val in chain, or if no set chain, then the var the val is stored
    var a
    a.b.c.d=5

    ab=a.b
    abc=ab.c

    x= abc.d=5 #set_field returns abc
    y= ab.c=x #set_field returns ab
    z= a.b=y #set_field returns a
    a=z

    a=a.b=ab.c=abc.d=5

* allow builder to declare anon array, that is converted to non array at compile time

THOUGHTS

* a copy should take a custom_ref, and change it to custom_mut
** use nonmut to allow a value to be returned but not set, and the returned value once copied can be set
** so if they do
    n.computed.inner_rect.left=5
*** then it will give missing method err, as rect returned is nonmut
*** but what if left returned by rect was always mut, then that would be writable
** no, better to use a no_setter field method

* if wanted inner_rect to be writable, but not replaceable then, not have set[inner_rect](node,rect)
** if wanted replaceable, then would return a setter
** but what if
    n.computed.inner_rect.left=5
*** but wanted computed to be read only, it would allow the setter to be done, but it would do nothing
**** could have a setter::inner_rect(node,computed), then returns a read_only err
***** could allow setter to know if it is in a set chain, and it's position in it, eg first or not
***** could have a special field setter, that returns a read_only err only eg
    lib_scope.field_named_no_setter("inner_rect")
        .custom_ref::<Entity>()
        .custom_ref::<Rect>()
        .end();

TODO
* could have lib_scope.setter_named("myfield",|context|{}).custom_mut_ref::<MyStruct>().float().end();
** where user provided method doesn't require a return? but still need a return for errors eg Ok(())
